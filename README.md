[00:00.33] Come on, get on up
[00:01.72] We're wild and we can't be tamed
[00:04.47] And we're turnin' the floor into
[00:05.89] A Zoo-ooh-ooh
[00:12.39] 
[00:07.40] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[00:09.41] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[00:11.32] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[00:13.22] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[00:19.72] 
[00:15.20] We live in a crazy world
[00:16.79] Caught up in a rat race
[00:18.86] Concrete jungle life
[00:20.76] Is sometimes a mad place
[00:22.24] It's you and me together
[00:24.31] At the end of a wild day
[00:25.97] Don't keep it all bottled up
[00:28.21] And release your energy
[00:39.71] 
[00:29.72] Hey—ooh—ay
[00:31.54] Only reason we are here
[00:33.04] Is to celebrate
[00:34.92] In a place where anyone can be anything
[00:38.85] Hold onto this moment
[00:40.29] Don't let it fade away
[00:42.33] Baby, keep the music playin'
[00:56.33] 
[00:44.66] Come on get on up
[00:46.55] We're wild and we can't be tamed
[00:48.69] And we're turnin' the floor into
[00:50.42] A Zoo-ooh-ooh
[00:52.26] Come on keep it up
[00:53.67] It's fun if you're down to play
[00:56.45] And we're turnin' the floor into
[00:57.76] A Zoo-ooh-ooh
[01:04.26] 
[00:59.50] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[01:01.07] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[01:03.03] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[01:04.80] Ah-a-a-a-a-ah
[01:05.57] A Zoo-ooh-ooh
[01:12.07] 
[01:07.05] We live in a heated time
[01:09.03] No chance to cool down
[01:10.81] Continuously confined
[01:12.45] And what do we do now?
[01:14.61] It's all about finding love
[01:16.57] Sometimes hard to come by
[01:18.51] But when it comes to us
[01:20.56] It's always a good time
[01:32.06] 
[01:21.88] Hey—ooh—ay
[01:23.69] Only reason we are here is to celebrate
[01:27.27] In a place where anyone can be anything
[01:30.90] Hold onto this moment
[01:32.23] Don't let it fade away
[01:34.21] Baby, keep the music playin'
[01:48.21] 
[01:36.81] Come on get on up

[01:44.15] Come on keep it up
[01:45.95] It's fun if you're down to play
[01:48.35] And we're turnin' the floor into
[01:50.28] A Zoo-ooh-ooh

[02:12.68] 
[02:07.27] I'll take you higher
[02:08.95] I'll take you higher
[02:11.09] We can't be tamed
